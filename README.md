# Jupyter_Article_Summarizer
Provide any article as input and provide with how many lines it needs to write the summary in and the code will generate a summary for you.
I have written the code with an unsupervised learning method which provides me with a feature that I don't have to train it everytime before running the project. I can simply run and the summary will be generated. I can also limit the summary based on characters rather than lines.
All you need to do is, provide the article as the input and the summary will be generated.
